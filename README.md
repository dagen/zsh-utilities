# zsh-utilities
I use ZSH as my preferred shell environment on most computers I use.  This repository represents a collection of utilities helpers I use frequently.


## Mechanism
I create a hidden folder in my home directory: `utilities`.  I thenc copy a variety of ZSH scripts into that folder.  I then source these files from my `.zshrc` file; allowing all of these to be embedded in my terminals.
